<h1>
  Hello World
</h1>
<p><strong>2023-09-08</strong></p>
<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>
<p>If you're reading this you are looking at my 4th attempt at trying to
create a presence on the internet. I set up a simply gatby page during
my first year at LTH but never really found myself using it to put out
any writing. Even though I want to believe that I value the act of
expressing thought in text, I have never really been that proficient
in doing it.</p>
<p>The site went unused for a couple of months before I rewrote it using
the rust frontend library <a href="https://yew.rs/">yew</a>. Despite being a good
exercise in building something nonconventional with rust it did not
really serve its purpose as a blog at all. I had no good way of taking
prose and generating sites out of it (without doing some markdown to
html conversion myself and then injecting it between my webassembly
driven rust components).</p>
<p>And like this I went back and forth between various libraries and
static site generators hoping to someday actually fulfill the literary
dreams of my manifesto writing, philosophy consuming teenage self.
Here I sit though, three years later, without more than a handful of
articles ever written (none of which are accessible on this site, or
that have survived the <code>rm -rf</code> command).</p>
<p>This time though, there are a couple of factors that I believe improve
the odds of me actually making this whole writing thing into a
practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have matured a bit. While I still have quite a sporadic and
undirected attention I do feel that my capacity to direct my efforts
during these last years have increased. I guess this is just an
aspect of my prefrontal cortex coalescing a bit.</li>
<li>I no longer work part time alongside my full time studies. During my
third year I worked part time as a consultant essentially doing
fullstack development in a variety of languages, tools and
frameworks. While I certainly gained a lot from the experience, my
studies and ability to spend time with my own creative endeavors
definitely suffered.</li>
<li>I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel with a fully custom site.</li>
</ul>
<p>This, combined with some ideas I have for fun projects to code and
articles to write mean that I do feel like I can actually populate
this site with something. If I actually do, of course, is left to be
seen.</p>
