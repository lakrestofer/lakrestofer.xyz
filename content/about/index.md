## About me

My name is Christoffer and I'm a fifth year computer science student
at [LTH sweden](https://www.lth.se/english/). Sometimes i
[write](/blog) and most of the time i
[code](https://github.com/lakrestofer).

## Socials

## Any good books I recommend?

Any work of
[Elizer Yudkowsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4533716.Eliezer_Yudkowsky)
is wholeheartedly recommended (more specifically a certain
[fanfic](https://hpmor.com/chapter/1) of a wizard with a bolt in his
face). I can also recommend the scifi works of the one and only Isaac
Asimov.

## May thought govern thought

A quote I've either heard from somewhere or that just popped into my
head one day. I't does give me some amount of deja vu (in the sense
that it makes a very specific impression on me that feels familiar).
It is about the wish or intent that a thought or idea ought to be a
good indication of future thoughts and ideas. This is in contrast to
how I actually believe the world with us in it works. It also gives me
some ideas of how I would construct a
[hard magic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson#Sanderson's_Laws_of_Magic)
if I ever were to write some fantasy one day.

## Tools for thought

I'm currently quite interested in the concept of using software to
improve human cognition (something that I hope to make into a career
and also write about). I believe that modeling cognitive phenomena
such as the
[spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect) in
software and then using it to improve ourselves might be one area were
much will be discovered in the 21th century.
